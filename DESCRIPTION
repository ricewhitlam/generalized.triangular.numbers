Description: 
    The triangular numbers are 1,3,6,10,15,21... 
    That is, the index n triangular number is the sum of the first n positive integers.
    The sequence is named as such because it counts the number of dots in triangular
    arrays with increasing numbers of rows. This sequence can be generalized by 
    altering the dimension under consideration. The triangular numbers are the two 
    dimensional case, but in three dimensions the tetrahedral numbers are obtained: 
    1,4,10,20,35,56... In fact, the generalization can be made so extreme as to allow
    a "dimension" equal to any complex number. In the case of numbers which are not 
    positive integers, the dot-counting interpretation breaks down, but the sequence 
    is still well-defined.
